         <p>The Sarah Sutton a"h Food Division has been a haven of sustenance for thousands of people over the years. It feeds hundreds of families a week, from those who don't know where their next meal is coming from, to those who just need an extra hand until they are back on their feet. Donations also come from all walks of life - supermarkets, celebrations, mothers who cook extra to relieve the burden of another, children who raise money to buy groceries, groups who come together to make batches of delicacies, and so much more</p>
